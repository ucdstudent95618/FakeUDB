Enrolled(CID,TERM,SID,SEAT,LEVEL,UNITS,CLASS,MAJOR,GRADE,STATUS) \\

In the scheema we will have three tables: Course, Student, Meeting. \\

Course: \\
We have the following attributes: CID, TERM, SUBJ, CRSE, SEC, UNITS \\
The key is CID, TERM \\

Student: \\
We have the following attributes: SEAT, SID, SURNAME, PREFNAME, LEVEL, UNITS,
CLASS, MAJOR, GRADE, STATUS, EMAIL \\
The key is SID \\
